        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello there! My name is Gustavo Martinez and I am excited to share a bit about myself with you. I am a 28-years-old currently working at Amazon with a growing passion for understanding and exploring the world of technology. I attended community college, majoring in Psychology, where I spent four fascinating years learning about human behaviors. While completing my education, I embarked into the retail industry for seven years. Over these years, I developed interpersonal and customer service skills while gaining valuable insights into consumer's behavior and building meaningful connections with customers. Driven by a desire to broaden my professional horizons, I recently decided to enrolled in a six-month coding bootcamp. This decision helped acquire programming and knowledge, enriching my problem-solve skills, and creativity. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better.</p>
